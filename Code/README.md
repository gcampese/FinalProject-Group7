# Code Repo

We coded in pair style programming in person, so we did not predominantly distribute individual coding tasks.

The only exception here is that Fernando created more intuitive preprocessing scripts to subset the data.

The preprocessing, training, testing, modeling, etc. is all in the final_project_code.py file.

Our subset (hosted in Google Bucket): wget https://storage.googleapis.com/finalproject-group7-ml2/train_subset.zip
