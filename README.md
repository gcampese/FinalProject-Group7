Final Project Repository for Machine Learning II

This GitHub repository serves as the base for our deliverables for our final research project in Machine Learning II. This project utilizes a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), known as ResNet50, in Keras. This neural network architecture is used to construct a model for image classification on the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy dataset.

The directory structure is as follows:
  
  Group-Proposal: folder that holds our group's project proposal.
  
  Final-Group-Project-Report: folder where group report detailing the project as a whole including research, methodologies, 
  and results.
  
  Final-Group-Presentation: folder where the Final Project PowerPoint to be presented resides.
  
  Code: folder where code that is used in this project lies.
  
  Individual Reports: folder that holds 2 Individual Reports detailing our individual efforts.
